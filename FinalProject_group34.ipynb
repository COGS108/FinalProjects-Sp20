We looked at the trends in the number of school shootings, what kinds of guns were used, the different types of laws in place in different states, the average age of school shooters, and the number of gun-related background checks in each state."

    "Before we continue, we would like to acknowledge that the following analyses reflect the dark subject matter of U.S. school shootings. We understand the gravity of the matter and hope to bring awareness to it in a respectful way.  \n",
    "\n",
    "All members of our team are interested in why school shootings occur so often in the U.S. In our lifetime, the media business has expanded to technological platforms such that citizens can read news within seconds of posting. With the media constantly sensationalizing every scary event, many in our generation feel a call to action— it is hard to stand by and do nothing when you receive constant updates on tragedies.\n",
    "\n",
    "One area of interest in analyzing the epidemic of school shootings is the topic of gun control. Especially since the last presidential election of Donald Trump, gun control has become even more of a heated political debate. In general, those in opposition of gun control argue that imposing gun control is a violation of the right to bear arms guaranteed by the Second Amendment of the US Constitution. The United States Concealed Carry Association (USCCA)$^{[2]}$ states that, “Gun control isn’t about guns. It’s about control,” and that, “freedom matters”.\n",
    "    \n",
    "On the opposite side of the debate, those in favor of gun control argue that it will save lives by limiting access to deadly weapons. The Every Town Organization$^{[1]}$ promotes “raising the age to purchase semi automatic firearms” and “requiring background check on all guns sales” to increase gun control which will decrease school shootings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since gun violence is such a broad topic, our team has decided to focus on shootings that occur in K-12 schools across the US. We seek to investigate how gun laws in each state correlate with school shootings. Specifically, what is the relationship between the amount of gun control a state has and the number of school shootings it has per year?\n",

    "To clean the data, we imported each of the aforementioned datasets as pandas DataFrames. First, we viewed what the DataFrames looked like in terms of their shape (number of rows and columns). Next, we made functions for each dataset to return a clean DataFrame for a given input year. Within these functions, we dropped rows and columns that we were not interested in. For example, in the K-12 School Shooting Dataset, we dropped rows for school shootings in which no individuals were injured or killed, as well as incidences that occurred off of school property. We did this because there are variety of ways to define a school shooting (e.g. some sources define it as a gun going off on school property, other sources define it as a shooting occurring between students on or off school property). We decided our definition of a school shooting is a shooting that happened on school property and in which at least one person was injured or killed. Also within these functions, we standardized columns to be the variable type we wanted, dropped any missing values, and renamed columns to be more interpretable."
