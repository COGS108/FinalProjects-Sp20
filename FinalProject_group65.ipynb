    "Everyone has an idea of what makes a restaurant upscale: we associate factors like expensive food, special cuisine, and a fancy name to mean a place has higher ratings. In this project, we are using data from the Michelin Star Restaurant Guide to find out if these factors really do make a restaurant more likely to gain stars. We then compare this to data from Yelp to see if these factors correlate to those of restaurants on Yelpâ€™s site. We used visualizations and predictive models to determine if there is any significance in cuisine, price, or name and higher ratings. "

    "When the Michelin Guide was started, its original goal was to promote travel, which in turn would theoretically increase tire sales as more people drove to visit the locations in the guide. By 1920, the guide itself cost 7 francs, and in 1936 the criteria for star rankings was published (\"About the Michelin Guide\"). Over time, the idea of particular restaurants being worth traveling to has turned the Michelin star into the symbol of prestige as we know it today. As of March 2020, Japan hosts the most Michelin-starred restaurants, with France coming in a close second (Boland). However, while Michelin stars are awarded worldwide, the official guides are broken down by region -- in some cases each country is a region, but in places like China and the US, regions are broken down by city (Boland).\n",
    "\n",
    "Michelin claims that five factors go into determining which restaurants get awarded stars -- three are based around food quality, with the other two considering the chef's personality and financial value of the experience (Bennett, 2017). However, the heavy connotations of a Michelin star have prompted some restaurants to ask the company to remove their star (Bennett, 2017) (Heighton-Ginns, 2018). It's clear from these anecdotes that the average layperson has a specific idea in their mind about what a Michelin-star restaurant is like, and as such there is a possibility of bias among Michelin's own restaurant inspectors. While food critics are quick to point to examples of casual eateries that have earned three stars, whether this particular standard is evenly applied remains to be seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help mitigate the number of confounding factors, we've also opted to compare any findings from the Michelin star data to Yelp data. Since Yelp is based on crowdsourced reviews (McCoy, 2020), and used most often for restaurants, it provides a good metric for understanding if any results from the Michelin data are truly statistically significant when compared to an overall population. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will also be limiting our analysis to restaurants in the United States, as cultural norms and tastes may affect how Michelin stars are awarded in other countries. The factors we will be considering in our analysis are the restaurant's name, cuisine, location, and price. \n",

We are using our research to answer what factors may lead to a greater likelihood of receiving Michelin Stars. Our scope of investigation will be strictly within the publicly available data that is available to the general public via the internet. We believe that these datasets are fully capable of answering our research question well.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this study, the main stakeholders will be the Michelin tire company itself because we are essentially evaluating the quality of their rating system, as well as restaurants that have received Michelin stars. In the case of this study, concluding that Michelin Guide has bias in these contributing factors would potentially affect Michelin in a way that suggests that their projected outcomes were unreasonable, casting doubt on the validity of the ratings. This could hurt both Michelin's brand as well as restaurants. On the other hand, it may become favorable to Michelin and become an appeal for the eyes of their investors if the case was that Michelin Guide indeed fulfilled its role. Additionally, it could serve as a tool for quality control should any bias be found, and in the long-term would be more helpful than harmful. In terms of the data based on Michelin Guide, we believe that it is not possible to be used for nefarious purposes because it is publicly available data from Michelin to create exposure (i.e favorable sale records to investors).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another possible stakeholder in this study is Yelp. However since we are not evaluating Yelp and just using it as a comparison tool it should not cause any harm to the company. We are also not evaluating any individual reviewer, any person that has made a review for Yelp or Michelin Star is not known and will not be individually affected by this analysis. We are however naming the restaurants involved to be able to factor if their name contributes to their reviews. While including names does have a potential risk of causing doubts of their reasons for having Michelin stars, we want to reiterate that we are not reviewing restaurants, we are just looking for correlations in factors that contribute to receiving Michelin Stars. Any restaurant reviews are already publicly available on Yelp. We also understand that the most contributing factor is the foodâ€™s quality and taste itself and that aspect is not included. We are not implying that any restaurant is good or bad, we are just looking for trends. \n",

Therefore, we concluded that any following unintended negative consequences from this research are negligible to Michelin; meaning, there are not necessarily any risks incurred in Michelin's stance.\n"

    "After our analysis was completed it was determined that we failed to reject the null hypothesis. There was no significant difference in ratings due to different types in the categories of cuisine, price,  or name. If a category had more stars it was based on just pure amount rather than the influence of any particular category. We have discovered that none of the factors we identified specifically contribute to higher ratings. There is a slight correlation between price and number of Michelin stars received, but it is unclear if a higher price was caused by reception of stars or a contributing factor due to lack of data over time. Michelin star data in general here is limited, as it encompasses only one year, and was further limited by geographical area (in our case, country).\n",
    " \n",
    "We used a mixture of visual data and predictive models to analyze our data. Most of the visualizations were skewed based on the amount in each category. For cuisine we also looked at the average stars per type of cuisine and found that there was not a big difference between categories. In the price data set the graphs showed that the higher prices tended to have higher ratings, especially when compared to the Yelp data, but confounding factors make it unclear the cause of this trend. We also looked at location data--where restaurants were located, but we already knew the Michelin guide is only based in certain areas, so this was mostly for visualization. Additionally, areas with a higher population density are likely to have more restaurants in general, which likely contributes to those areas having more Michelin stars. We then used SVR to implement TF-IDf for the predictions made for the name and cuisine categories. Then we used Linear regression to make predictions for the category of price. These predictive models showed no statistical significance for higher ratings based on any of our tested factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we found no statistical significance, there is still a chance that we missed something in our analysis that might have changed this. We also found that there is popularity in some cuisines, which might imply that certain cuisines may have more of a chance of getting Michelin stars in general. We also did not test every factor of a restaurant so there may in fact be something else that makes a higher contribution to ratings. This data was also only focused in the United States so our information can only be based from this region. As of our current findings, it seems most appropriate to believe that Michelin is properly basing its star awards on the five factors it claims to use.\n"
