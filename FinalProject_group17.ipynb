    "# Background and Prior Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into datasets, we first need to understand our subject, Dota2. We will present 2 introductions to the game, a long one and a short one. The longer one contains more details about the game. The shorter one only contains a few pieces of information that matters to our project. We would suggest reading the longer one to get a better understanding of the game. However, if you are run out of time, you can just read the shorter one.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Long introduction starts here\n",
    "\n",
    "Dota2 is a popular multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Valve. The full name is Defense of the Ancients 2. It was published in 2013 and so far, it has attracted millions of players around the world. Each year, a championship is held for professional players/clubs to compete with each other. Every year, the championship has a prize pool of over 10,000,000 dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dota2 is played in matches between two teams of five players. Each match is a new start. The past matches have no effect on current matches. Meaning if you start a new match, the only thing that you can carry on for this match is your own skill and experience. For a normal player, when you play the game, you can play alone and the system will match you up with 4 other players to form a team to compete with 5 other players in your opponent side, or you can play with your friends, and the system will fill your team with other players to form a team of 5 and match you up with 5 other players in your opponent side as well. Anyway, each match will start with 5 players vs 5 players. Also, one team is called Radiant and one team is called Dire. The assignment is random.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the game is to destroy the ancient on the opponent side and protect your ancient. We will explain everything in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before a match start, the first thing that a player needs to do is to select a hero. A hero is a special unit that you control. There are more than 100 heroes in the game. Each hero has different abilities and attributes so that they function differently, we will explain this later. Everyone would select a hero so each team would have 5 heroes. For professional matches, there is a banning phase, where you can ban the heroes that you dislike to forbid the opponent side to select this hero. But in this project, we would not consider this. We only need to know that a match starts with 5 heroes on each side.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each hero is a unit controlled by players. Each hero has many attributes: health, mana, attack damage, attack speed, etc. We will explain all of them. Note that all the attributes can be increased/decreased by abilities and items.\n",
    "\n",
    "Health: Health is the value that determines whether a hero is alive or dead.  Each hero has maximum health. Its health cannot exceed this value. Each hero starts with full health in the game, health can be lowered and raised by many methods. For example, being attacked by enemy heroes would reduce your health value. Staying in base and rest would recover your health. Most of the abilities of the heroes are for damaging or recover the health of the heroes. The maximum health can be increased by abilities and items.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mana: The mana is spent to use abilities. It works the same with health, but your hero would not die if it runs out of mana, it just couldn't use any abilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Move speed: The speed that your hero walks around the map. \n",
    "\n",
    "Basic attack: Each hero can attack any opponent units within its attack range, which is different for all heroes. Attack damage would determine the amount of damage that is dealt for this attack and attack speed would determine the length of time between each attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abilities: Each hero normally has four different abilities, three normal abilities, and a powerful ultimate ability. Each ability is unique. You can learn/level up your abilities for each level you gain. Some abilities can deal damage to enemy units or heroes, some abilities can increase/decrease the attributes of heroes, some can heal friendly units, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Respawn: If health value drops to 0, a hero is dead (so is all other units in the game). The dead hero needs to wait some amount of time to respawn with full health in the team base. The length of the time is determined by many things, and it will get longer as the game time gets longer. For example, if your hero died at the start of the game, you only need 10 seconds to respawn, but if your hero died 30 minutes after the game started, you would need about 1 minute to respawn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Level: All heroes start with level 1. Then the hero can gain experience by the death of enemy units around the hero. If the hero gains enough experience, it will level up. When a hero level up, its attributes improve and the hero can learn/improve one ability. The higher the level a hero is, the more powerful the hero is. The maximum level is 25.\n",
    "\n",
    "Item: Each hero can purchase items from stores using gold, gold can be earned by kill enemy units. Items are for improving attributes. Some items have to give additional abilities for heroes to use. The better a hero's items are, the more powerful the hero is. A hero can maximumly have 6 items.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the match has begun. The map for Dota2 stays the same for all matches. The map is a square. The Radiant team is on the left bottom side of the map and the Dire team is on the top right side of the map. There are many components of the map: base, lane, and jungle, etc. We will explain each one of them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Base: The base is the place for heroes to rest and purchase items. Each team has one base. For Radiant, the base is in the left bottom corner of the map Each hero would start the game in the team base. For Radiant, the base is in the top right corner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ancient: The goal of the game is to destroy the enemy ancient. It is located near the base of each team. A team wins by destroying the enemy ancient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tower: Each team has many towers located on the map to protect the ancient. Each tower cannot be moved or controlled by players, but it will automatically attack any enemy units with the attack range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lane: The map has three lanes: top, mid, and bottom. Each lane has towers to defense.\n",
    "\n",
    "Minion: Each lane would produce minions. Minions are units that cannot be controlled and constantly move towards the enemy ancients unless enemy units are in range, then the minions would attack enemy units. Killing minions can gain gold and experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jungle: Each rest of the map is the jungle. There are neutral creeps in the jungle that you can kill for gold and experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above-explained most of the game. For further details, please refer to https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Dota_2_Wiki\n",
    "\n",
    "Then let us define some terms for the game for this paper to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "KDA: Three values that determine the performance of a hero. Kill/Death/Assist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kill: Damaging enemy heroes and drops their health below 0. When the enemy hero dies, the last hero that deals damage to it gains the kill, and its kill count plus one. The kill will reward with gold and experience to empower heroes. More kills mean more powerful the hero is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Death: When the hero's health drop to 0, it dies, and its death count plus one. The dead hero would lose some gold and need to wait for time to respawn. The more death a hero has, the less powerful a hero is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assist: When a hero helps a friendly hero to kill enemy hero, it gains assist. The assist also rewards some gold and experience, but not as much as the kill.\n",
    "\n",
    "Farm: The action of killing enemy minions and creeps to gain gold and experience. Some heroes need a long farming phase, meaning that it needs to kill a lot of minions and creeps to buy good items and have a high level to become powerful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gank: The action of killing enemy heroes to gain gold and experience. Some heroes are good at ganking, meaning that they can easily kill enemy heroes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Carrier: The hero that deals high damage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Support: The hero that supports friendly heroes to farm or gank. For example, heroes with abilities that can heal friend heroes are usually support heroes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Teamfight: Fights between multiple heroes from each side. Usually leads to kill and death of heroes.\n",

    "Dota2 is played with 5 players vs 5 players, one side is called radiant and one side is called dire. Each game is a new start, meaning that earlier games have no effects on later games. The game started with each player select a hero. There are more 112 heroes in the game right now. Different heroes have different abilities and different power. In the game, players can kill minions and opponent heroes to earn gold and experience. Gold can buy items and experience can level up. Items and level up will empower your hero. So more items and higher-level mean more powerful. The goal of the game is to destroy the opponent ancient, the structure located in the opponent base. One match usually takes 25-45 mins.\n",

The sum of current gold is total gold. Because the total gold did not divide the factor, it contains less information than skill level and would disrupt our model.

Thus, the dataset is very secure. The dataset contains 50000 ranked ladder matches from the Dota 2 data dump created by Opendota or Yasp. Therefore, we expect that it does not exclude specific groups. We will also list out additional citations of the dataset at the end under the Reference tab.

    "# Conclusion and Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "We used 50000 Dota2 ranked match data to build a machine learning model to predict the outcome of a match at 5 mins, 10 mins, 15 mins and 20 mins with over 70% accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to build the model, first, we considered the gold/experience difference at current game time. It turns out that if a team is leading gold/experience at 5 mins, they have about 60% chance to win the game. This is certainly not enough. Therefore, we added hero selection to our model. We calculated hero strength, hero synargy and hero counter and put all data into a machine learning model. It turns out to successfully predict 68% matches for 5 mins. Lastly, we considered the skill level of a player according to the performence and calculate the team skill level. The final model can predict correctly 75% matches at 5 mins, 76% at 10 mins and 77% at 15 mins.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have successfully developed profiles to determine the strength of each hero, hero synargy and hero counter. We also developed profile to determine how well a player is at certain game time. We implement these profile and build a machine learning model. Our machine learning model could predict the outcome of matches with over 70% accuracy. The limitation for our project is that our project is only valid for the patch of the game when the dataset was created. If Dota2 updated its patch, which it is very often, then we need to use new dataset to do analysis again. Another limitation is that we cannot access the history of a player. If we can, we could improve the algorithm for calculating skill level, which will greatly help the prediction success rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project has impacts on gaming society. For Dota2 players, this project could help them determine the chance to win the game when they are playing. Also, this approach could also help analysis other video game as well.\n"
